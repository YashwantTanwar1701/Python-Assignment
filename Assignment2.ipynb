    "1. Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Ans: Natural language queries in Power BI allow users to interact with data using everyday language, making it easier for non-technical users to explore and analyze data. Some advantages of natural queries include:\n",
    "Accessibility: Natural language queries enable users to access and analyze data without requiring knowledge of complex query languages or data modeling concepts.\n",
    "Ease of Use: Users can ask questions in their own language, eliminating the need to learn specific query syntax or commands.\n",
    "Faster Insights: Natural language queries provide quick access to insights by allowing users to ask questions and receive immediate answers.\n",
    "Example: A user might ask, \"What were the total sales for Product A last month?\" Power BI interprets this query, retrieves the relevant data from the underlying dataset, and presents the total sales for Product A during the specified time period."
